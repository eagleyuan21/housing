A simulation of Northeastern's housing lottery system

Northeastern's on campus housing is a mess, where it assigns lottery numbers for selection of housing. Second year numbers start at 5000, and my group had a bad number, so I wanted to figure out what the average amount of rooms would be selected before us.

This assumes that all the lottery numbers are randomly assigned and all groups are of four people.
